# Small-Projects-in-Unity
Small to Medium sized Projects I created in University.
The Lonely Island was the first real Game i created.
I uploaded all my Projects here to show my Progress throughout my study Period.
The Project here furthest into my study is the ant simulator where i was assigned to do all the pathfinding related Programing and the random creation of the anthill.
